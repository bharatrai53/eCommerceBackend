# eCommerceBackend

## Description
The E-Commerce Backend was created to increase my ability to work with MySQL and interact with the seeded data with GET, PUT, and POST requests. This application is a functional backend that allows an eCommerce site to list their products, categories, and tags for their various items as well as interact with that data by adding, deleting, or updating the items that they have stored.

## Installation and Usage 

Clone this repo 
Install packages using npm i
Run the db from the schema folder in MySQL
Run npm seed to use the sample data
Run node server.js to start the server
Use Postman to test the APIs of your choice
